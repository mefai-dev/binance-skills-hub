# Smart Money Radar

## Overview

Smart Money Radar is an institutional positioning intelligence system that uses **6 data signals exclusive to Binance** — data that no other cryptocurrency exchange publishes — to generate composite Smart Money Scores, detect smart-vs-retail divergences, and classify market regimes in real-time.

The core insight: Binance is the only exchange that simultaneously publishes top trader positioning (account ratio AND position ratio), global retail positioning, taker buy/sell ratios, and detailed open interest history. By combining these orthogonal data streams, Smart Money Radar reveals what institutional traders are doing **before** price reflects it.

## Why This Skill Is Unique

### Binance-Exclusive Data Advantage

| Data Signal | Binance | Bybit | OKX | Kraken | Coinbase |
|-------------|---------|-------|-----|--------|----------|
| Top Trader L/S Account Ratio | **YES** | No | No | No | No |
| Top Trader L/S Position Ratio | **YES** | No | No | No | No |
| Global L/S Account Ratio | **YES** | Partial | Partial | No | No |
| Taker Buy/Sell Volume Ratio | **YES** | No | No | No | No |
| Historical Open Interest | **YES** | Partial | Partial | No | No |
| Premium Index + Funding | **YES** | Yes | Yes | No | No |

**Result: 4 out of 6 signals are ONLY available on Binance.** This skill cannot be replicated on any other exchange.

## Architecture

### The 6 Factor Model

Each factor is normalized to a -1 to +1 scale where positive = bullish, negative = bearish:

#### Factor 1: Smart Money Direction
**Source:** `topLongShortPositionRatio` (Binance-exclusive)
**What it measures:** What the top 20% of traders by position size are doing
**Signal:** ratio > 1 = smart money going long, ratio < 1 = going short
```
smartDir = clamp((topPosRatio - 1) × 5, -1, +1)
```

#### Factor 2: Retail Contrarian
**Source:** `globalLongShortAccountRatio`
**What it measures:** What ALL traders are doing (dominated by retail)
**Signal:** Inverted — when retail goes long, it's a bearish signal (and vice versa)
```
retailContra = clamp((1 - retailRatio) × 5, -1, +1)
```

#### Factor 3: Smart vs Retail Divergence
**Source:** Computed from Factor 1 and Factor 2 sources
**What it measures:** The gap between institutional and retail positioning
**Signal:** Large divergence = high-conviction signal (smart money disagrees with crowd)
```
divergence = clamp((topPosRatio - retailRatio) × 3, -1, +1)
```

#### Factor 4: Taker Pressure
**Source:** `takerlongshortRatio` (Binance-exclusive)
**What it measures:** Aggressive order flow — are buyers or sellers hitting the book harder?
**Signal:** ratio > 1 = aggressive buying, ratio < 1 = aggressive selling
```
takerPressure = clamp((takerRatio - 1) × 5, -1, +1)
```

#### Factor 5: Funding Signal (Contrarian)
**Source:** `premiumIndex`
**What it measures:** Leverage positioning balance via funding rate
**Signal:** Contrarian — negative funding = longs get paid = bullish (market is under-positioned long)
```
fundingSignal = clamp(-fundingBps × 0.1, -1, +1)
```

#### Factor 6: OI Momentum
**Source:** `openInterestHist`
**What it measures:** Whether new positions are being opened (conviction) or closed (retreat)
**Signal:** Rising OI = conviction behind the current direction
```
oiMomentum = clamp(oiChange% × 0.3, -1, +1)
```

### Composite Smart Money Score (0-100)

```
avgSignal = mean(all 6 factors)
agreeing = count(factors with same sign as avgSignal AND magnitude > 0.1)
confluence = agreeing / 6

smartScore = min(100, |avgSignal| × confluence × 250)
```

The score rewards both signal strength (magnitude) and factor agreement (confluence). A strong signal backed by 6/6 factors scores much higher than a strong signal backed by only 2/6 factors.

### Direction Classification

| avgSignal | Direction | Meaning |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| > +0.08 | **LONG** | Smart money is bullish |
| < -0.08 | **SHORT** | Smart money is bearish |
| -0.08 to +0.08 | **NEUTRAL** | No clear institutional bias |

### Market Regime Classification

| Condition | Regime | Interpretation |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Score ≥ 60 + LONG + OI rising | **ACCUMULATION** | Institutions quietly building long positions |
| Score ≥ 60 + SHORT + OI rising | **DISTRIBUTION** | Institutions distributing / building shorts |
| Score ≥ 40 + stable OI | **POSITIONING** | Institutions adjusting positions without conviction |
| All other | **NEUTRAL** | No clear institutional activity |

### Auto-Generated Market Brief

When Smart Score ≥ 50, the system generates a natural language intelligence brief:

> *"Smart money accumulating. Retail going short, longs getting paid."*

This condenses the 6-factor analysis into a single actionable sentence, making institutional positioning immediately understandable.

"
```

## Use Cases

1. **Signal Generation** — Use Smart Score ≥ 60 with LONG/SHORT direction as a high-conviction trading signal. The 6-factor confluence dramatically reduces false positives compared to single-indicator signals.

2. **Retail Fade Strategy** — When smart money divergence is high (Factor 3), take the institutional side. Historical evidence shows top traders consistently outperform retail positioning.

3. **Accumulation Detection** — Identify when institutions are quietly building positions (ACCUMULATION regime) before the move becomes obvious to retail.

4. **Risk Management** — When your existing position conflicts with smart money direction, consider reducing size or hedging.

5. **Funding Arbitrage Enhancement** — Combine funding signal (Factor 5) with smart money direction to identify funding arbitrage opportunities where the carry trade is also supported by institutional flow.

6. **Market Regime Timing** — Use regime classification to adjust strategy: trend-follow during ACCUMULATION/DISTRIBUTION, mean-revert during NEUTRAL.

## Notes

- All 6 endpoints are public and require no authentication
- 4 out of 6 data sources are exclusive to Binance (not available on any other exchange)
- Refresh interval: 25 seconds
- Default watchlist: 12 major futures pairs (BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, XRP, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, LINK, LTC, APT, ARB)
- The system is designed around signal orthogonality — each factor measures a different market dimension to minimize correlated false positives
- Smart Money Score should be used in conjunction with technical analysis, not as a standalone trading system
- Historical backtesting suggests scores ≥ 70 with 5+ agreeing factors have the highest win rate
- During extreme volatility events, all factors may temporarily align regardless of smart money activity — use the OI Momentum factor as a filter for genuine position building vs panic-driven moves

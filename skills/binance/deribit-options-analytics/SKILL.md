## Computed Analytics

From the raw book summary data, the following are computed:

| Metric | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| **Put/Call Ratio** | Total Put OI / Total Call OI |
| **Max Pain Strike** | Strike where total option holder pain is minimized |
| **Avg Call IV** | Mean implied volatility of call options |
| **Avg Put IV** | Mean implied volatility of put options |
| **Top Strikes** | Strikes sorted by total OI (call + put) |

### Max Pain Calculation

For each strike S, pain = sum of (Call OI * max(0, S-K) + Put OI * max(0, K-S)) across all strikes K. The strike with minimum total pain is max pain — price tends to gravitate toward this level at expiry.

## Use Cases

- **Volatility Trading**: Compare implied vs realized vol for mispricing
- **Hedging Decisions**: P/C ratio signals market sentiment (>1 = bearish hedging)
- **Expiry Positioning**: Max pain indicates likely expiry settlement zone
- **Strike Selection**: OI distribution shows where liquidity concentrates

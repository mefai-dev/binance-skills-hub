  }
]
```

### Heatmap Calculations

```
Funding Rate% = lastFundingRate × 100
Annualized Rate% = Funding Rate% × 3 × 365  (funding applied every 8 hours)

Market Sentiment:
- Average Rate > 0.01%: Market is moderately bullish (longs paying shorts)
- Average Rate > 0.05%: Market is very bullish (expensive to hold longs)
- Average Rate < -0.01%: Market is bearish (shorts paying longs)
```

## Use Cases

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Average funding rate across all contracts indicates overall market sentiment
2. **Funding Arbitrage**: Find extreme positive rates to short futures + long spot and collect funding
3. **Overleveraged Detection**: Extremely high positive funding indicates overleveraged long positions
4. **Reversal Signals**: Sustained extreme funding rates often precede mean reversion
5. **Cross-Asset Screening**: Compare funding rates across assets to find relative value opportunities
6. **Cost Analysis**: Calculate the cost of holding perpetual futures positions over time

- Normal funding range: -0.01% to +0.01%
- Extreme rates (>0.1% or <-0.1%) indicate potential reversal conditions

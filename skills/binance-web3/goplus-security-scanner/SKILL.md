# GoPlus Security Scanner

Independent, third-party token security analysis using GoPlus Security API — the most comprehensive on-chain security scanner with coverage across 40+ blockchains.

## Why This Matters

Binance's built-in Token Audit skill provides one layer of security verification. GoPlus provides a completely independent second opinion with deeper contract analysis. When both agree a token is safe, confidence is high. When they disagree, that's a critical warning signal.

**Key difference from Token Audit:** GoPlus provides granular contract-level analysis (hidden ownership, self-destruct capability, proxy contracts, tax modification functions) that goes beyond basic audit checks.

## Security Scoring Algorithm

### Risk Classification

Score tokens on a 0-100 safety scale based on GoPlus results:

```
safety_score = 100

# Critical risks (-30 each)
if is_honeypot == "1":         safety_score -= 30
if cannot_buy == "1":          safety_score -= 30
if cannot_sell_all == "1":     safety_score -= 30

# High risks (-20 each)
if hidden_owner == "1":        safety_score -= 20
if selfdestruct == "1":        safety_score -= 20
if can_take_back_ownership == "1": safety_score -= 20
if owner_change_balance == "1":    safety_score -= 20

# Medium risks (-10 each)
if slippage_modifiable == "1":     safety_score -= 10
if is_blacklisted == "1":         safety_score -= 10
if transfer_pausable == "1":      safety_score -= 10
if is_proxy == "1":               safety_score -= 10

# Low risks (-5 each)
if is_mintable == "1":            safety_score -= 5
if external_call == "1":         safety_score -= 5
if trading_cooldown == "1":      safety_score -= 5

# Tax penalties
if float(buy_tax) > 0.05:        safety_score -= 15   # >5% buy tax
if float(sell_tax) > 0.05:       safety_score -= 15   # >5% sell tax

# Positive signals (+5 each)
if is_open_source == "1":        safety_score += 5
if trust_list == "1":            safety_score += 5

safety_score = max(0, min(100, safety_score))
```

### Risk Levels

| Score | Level | Color | Action |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 80-100 | SAFE | Green | Low risk — standard due diligence applies |
| 60-79 | CAUTION | Yellow | Some risks detected — review before trading |
| 40-59 | WARNING | Orange | Multiple risks — trade with extreme caution |
| 0-39 | DANGER | Red | High risk of rug-pull or honeypot — avoid |

## Analytical Recipes

### Recipe 1: Dual-Audit Cross-Validation

Cross-reference GoPlus with Binance's built-in Token Audit:

```bash
# Step 1: GoPlus check
curl -s "https://api.gopluslabs.io/api/v1/token_security/56?contract_addresses=CONTRACT_ADDRESS"

# Step 2: Binance Token Audit (via Skills Hub query-token-audit)
# Compare results — discrepancies are red flags

# Agreement Matrix:
# Both SAFE → High confidence safe
# GoPlus SAFE + Binance WARN → Investigate tax/audit differences
# GoPlus WARN + Binance SAFE → Check contract-level risks GoPlus found
# Both DANGER → Avoid — confirmed high risk
```

### Recipe 2: Creator Reputation Check

Assess the deployer's track record:

```bash
# Check token security — look at honeypot_with_same_creator field
curl -s "https://api.gopluslabs.io/api/v1/token_security/56?contract_addresses=CONTRACT_ADDRESS"

# If honeypot_with_same_creator == "1":
#   → Creator has deployed honeypots before
#   → IMMEDIATE RED FLAG regardless of other scores
#   → Check creator_address to see all their deployments
```

### Recipe 3: Holder Concentration Risk

Analyze token distribution for dump risk:

```bash
# From the response, examine:
# - holders[0].percent → if > 0.50 → extreme concentration risk
# - Sum of top 10 holders → if > 0.80 → high dump risk
# - creator_percent → if > 0.10 → insider risk
# - owner_percent → if > 0.05 → governance risk
# - lp_holders → check if LP is locked (is_locked: 1)
```

**Holder Risk Table:**

| Top 10 Concentration | LP Locked | Risk |
|----------------------|-----------|------|
| < 30% | Yes | LOW — distributed, LP secured |
| < 30% | No | MEDIUM — distributed but LP can be pulled |
| 30-60% | Yes | MEDIUM — concentrated but LP locked |
| 30-60% | No | HIGH — concentrated AND LP vulnerable |
| > 60% | Any | CRITICAL — whale can dump entire supply |

### Recipe 4: Batch Security Screening

Audit multiple tokens in one request for portfolio-level security:

```bash
# Audit up to 100 tokens in one call
ADDRESSES="0xaddr1,0xaddr2,0xaddr3,0xaddr4,0xaddr5"
curl -s "https://api.gopluslabs.io/api/v1/token_security/56?contract_addresses=$ADDRESSES"

# Parse results: any token with safety_score < 60 should be flagged
# Useful for: portfolio audits, watchlist screening, scanner integration
```

**Most relevant for Binance ecosystem:**
- `56` — BNB Smart Chain (BSC)

## Important Notes

- GoPlus is a **third-party** security service — independent from Binance
- All endpoints are **public** and require **no API key** (free tier: 30 req/min)
- Security analysis is **point-in-time** — contract upgrades or ownership changes can alter risk after scanning
- A clean GoPlus report does **not guarantee** safety — always combine with fundamental analysis
- `is_proxy == "1"` means the contract is upgradeable — the owner could change behavior at any time
- Batch requests (up to 100 addresses) are recommended for efficiency
- Response includes `dex` array showing DEX listings with liquidity amounts
- `is_in_cex.cex_list` shows which centralized exchanges list the token

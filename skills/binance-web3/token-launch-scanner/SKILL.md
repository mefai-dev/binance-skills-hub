# Token Launch Safety Scanner Skill

## Overview

Combines DexScreener's top boosted token list with GoPlus security scanning to
create a safety-scored view of newly launched tokens.

## Data Sources

| Source | Endpoint | TTL | Purpose |
|--------|----------|-----|---------|
| DexScreener | `https://api.dexscreener.com/token-boosts/top/v1` | 30s | Top boosted tokens |
| GoPlus | GoPlus Token Security API | 120s | Per-token security audit |

## Safety Scoring

Each token starts at 100 and loses points for risk flags:

| Risk Flag | Penalty | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| is_honeypot | -30 | Cannot sell token |
| hidden_owner | -20 | Owner address is hidden |
| selfdestruct | -20 | Contract can self-destruct |
| is_mintable | -15 | Token supply can increase |
| can_take_back_ownership | -15 | Ownership can be reclaimed |
| is_proxy | -10 | Upgradeable proxy contract |
| is_blacklisted | -10 | Address blacklisting enabled |
| external_call | -10 | External contract calls |
| transfer_pausable | -10 | Transfers can be paused |
| buy_tax > 10% | -10 | High buy tax |
| sell_tax > 10% | -10 | High sell tax |

### Score Classification
- **70-100**: Safe (green)
- **40-69**: Caution (yellow)
- **0-39**: Danger (red)

## Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| name | Token name from GoPlus or DexScreener |
| chain | Blockchain (BSC, ETH, etc.) |
| amount | DexScreener boost amount |
| safetyScore | Computed safety score (0-100) |
| risks | List of detected risk flags |
| riskLevel | low / medium / high classification |
